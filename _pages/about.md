I am an undergraduate student @ Yonsei University, majoring in physics and electrical & electronic engineering. I am currently studying machine learning and computer vision with the goal of entering a combined MS–PhD program in the spring of 2027.

In particular, I am interested in neural network compression (e.g., network quantization) and physical AI for low power devices, as well as diffusion models motivated by a strong interest in mathematics.
